LINE 18-19: make it with input and check the capitol letter


LINE 21: make is so that we can decide the numbers of pilots, make a for loop for the numbers of pilots to enter and then ask as many times to enter the name of the pilot. store the pilots in an appropriate data structure (no need, u can directly change name of pilot in program, maybe do a global variable or make it visible in the code)


LINE 48: use a data structure to store the drivers' names and then extract them in order in the plot title + 48-50 play with ratios numbers
