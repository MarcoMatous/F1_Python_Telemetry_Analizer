# F1_Python_Telemetry_Analizer
This project aims to build something with the programming and data analysis skills I have learned in my first semester of mechanical engineering while combining my passion and enthusiasm for motorsport :).


--WHAT and GOALS--
	- analise historical datas and analysie races' outcomes
	- analise&comparing driving strategies of teams (tyres, speeds, laptimes, brakings, rpms and much more)
	- comparing drivers with the best driver( winning one) to optimize race strategy or check wich component of the car needs some improvements to imporve race performance based on the competition
 
--HOW--
I first studied the fastf1 library and reviewed some concepts on plotting graphs in a clear and readable way. I then proceeded with some guidance of examples on the fastf1 documentation and later I implemented some of my knowledge in pyhton (mainly data strucutres, plottings, qualitative research and quantitative research and testing) to complete the project and reach project objectives.

--RESULTS and CONCLUSION--
The program returns graphs of tyre comparison, laptimes comparison and 1to1 driver race strategy comparison. The choiche of using more python files has been made to keep things in order, easier debugging and better graph visualisation as it's possible to keep more figures on the screen. 

--SKILLS--
	- create a github environment ( GitHub, GitHub Desktop)
	- data analysis
	- data visualization
	- python
	- FastF1 v2.2 and v3.2
 	- qualitative and quantitative reaserch
